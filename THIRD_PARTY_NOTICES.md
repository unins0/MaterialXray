The notices below identify separately licensed material distributed with, compiled into, or downloaded by the application.

## Corresponding Source

The preferred source form for each Material Xray release is available from:

- https://github.com/reddxae/MaterialXray
- https://github.com/reddxae/MaterialXray/releases

The release workflow publishes Material Xray's source archive and an `Xray-core-<version>-source.tar.gz` archive containing the corresponding Xray-core source and vendored Go modules used by the distributed executables.

## Xray-core

- Component: Xray-core, Linux and Android arm64 executables; `third_party/xray/VERSION` identifies the version
- Project: https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core
- Source tags: https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/tags
- License: Mozilla Public License 2.0; see `third_party/xray/LICENSE`

Material Xray distributes unmodified official Xray-core release executables as separate child processes. Xray-core is licensed under MPL-2.0; licenses for its transitive Go modules are preserved in the corresponding-source archive.

The corresponding-source archive contains the vendored Go modules and preserves the original license files shipped with those modules.

The protocol definitions under `app/src/main/proto/` are reduced, Java-targeted versions of Xray-core protocol definitions and remain governed by MPL-2.0.

## Mozilla CA Certificate Bundle

- Component: Mozilla CA certificate store converted to PEM by curl; `third_party/mozilla-ca-bundle/VERSION` identifies the dated revision
- Source: https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html
- Upstream data: https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/file/tip/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt
- License: Mozilla Public License 2.0; see `legal/licenses/MPL-2.0.txt`

Material Xray uses this bundle only as an additive trust fallback on Android 7 after the platform trust store rejects a certificate chain.

## Material Color Utilities

- Component: selected Java color-scheme generation sources under `app/src/main/java/com/google/android/material/color/utilities/`
- Project: https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities
- Source revision: https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities/tree/f0268a6396f5e97ddef9def2651ed0dd6fefd57a/java
- License: Apache License 2.0; Copyright Google LLC; see `third_party/licenses/material-color-utilities/LICENSE`
